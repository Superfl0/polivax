# This is an open source project
Polivax (short for political vaccinations) is a project that aims to monitor the global distribution and use of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Despite recent rollouts in high income countries, to date none of the available vaccines have been made publicly available in any low income countries.

All code and data can be found on [Github](https://github.com/upfl0/polivax)
